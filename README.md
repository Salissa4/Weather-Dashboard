# Weather-Dashboard

## Server Side API

Goal: Build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser featuring dynamic HTML and CSS with data from a third-party API. 

Actions:
1. User is given a form with input fields to obtain information about the weather
2. When a user inputs a city the user is given current and future conditions for that city, and the city is added to user history
3. Upon viewing the weather as a user I am able to see the city name, date, icons representing weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index
4. When UV index is viewed, I am presented with a color indicating whether the conditions are favorable, moderate or severe
5. As I view future weather conditions I see a 5-day forecast displaying date, icon representing weather conditions, temperature, wind speed and the humidity
6. When a user clicks on a city in the search history the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city
